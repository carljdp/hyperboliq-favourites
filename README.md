## Tech Stack & Decisions

### Mandatory Tech
As specified in the assessment's requirements:
  - React (front-end framework)
  - React Bootstrap (front-ent UI framework)
  - React Easy-Peasy (front-end state store)
  - RapidAPI
  - JavaScript Fetch() only please, no packages for API calls.
  - Use only React functional components and hooks.

### Initial Decisions
  - Version Control: Git - It's all I've ever known.
  - Branching Model: Trunk based - to force shorter lived branches, for faster iterations.
  - Language: TypeScript - Well, why not?
  - Editors: VS Code, Webstorm, etc.
  - Front-end Routing: `react-router`
